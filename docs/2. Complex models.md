# Complex Models

Some models may have more complex data structures than a basic user.

Before diving directly into the complex data structures, there's some underlying logic that needs mentioned regarding how the mapper analyzes and infers `DataTypes`. Currently, most natives in PHP will automatically be analyzed by the mapper but certain types require
additional configuration.

## Automatically Analyzed Types

Below is a list of types that are automatically analyzed by the mapper:

* `string`
* `int`
* `float`
* `bool`
* `array` *(note: this will accept any array structure)*
* `mixed`
* `null`
* `BackedEnum`

## Using DataType Attributes

If you have a model that has a property that is not a native type, you can attach the respective `DataType` to the property.

```php
<?php

use StringPhp\Models\DataTypes\IntType;
use StringPhp\Models\Model;

class User extends Model {
    #[IntType]
    public int $id;
}
```

By using the `IntType` attribute, you can also make certain properties optional by setting `required` to false.

```php
<?php

use StringPhp\Models\DataTypes\IntType;
use StringPhp\Models\Model;

class User extends Model {
    #[IntType(required: false)]
    public int $id;
}
```

...(to be completed)
