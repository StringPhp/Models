# What are models?

In this context, models are used as ways to represent complex data structures in a more manageable way. This is done by creating a class that represents the data structure and then using that class to interact.

## Example Model

Lets say we have a user model that represents a user in a database. The user model would have properties that represent the user's data. Instead of storing this as an array or trying to manually bind the data to a class. We can first mockup our user model like so:

```php
<?php

use StringPhp\Models\Model;

class User extends Model
{
    public int $id;
    public string $name;
    public string $email;
    public string $password;
}
```

And for this example, we'll use an array as our data source:

```php
<?php

$userData = [
    'id' => 1,
    'name' => 'John Doe',
    'email' => 'johndoe@example.com'
    'password' => 'password123'
];

$userModel = User::map($userData);

echo $userModel->name; // John Doe
```

...(to be completed)
